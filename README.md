# Tree Crown Segmentation from Multispectral Satellite Imagery  
**ISRO–NRSC | Project Intern | 05 May 2025 – 30 September 2025**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **pixel-level tree crown mapping** from multispectral LISS-4 satellite imagery as part of a wall-to-wall vegetation monitoring workflow. Tree areas are labeled as **1**, and non-tree areas as **0**, explicitly excluding crops and shrubs. A deep learning–based segmentation pipeline was developed to address fine-scale variability and limited training data.

## 📸 Dataset Preparation

### **Source Data**
- **Input imagery:** LISS-4 multispectral scenes  
- **Reference masks:** Manually prepared using high-resolution KOMSAT imagery  
- Masks generated by overlaying centroid points on LISS-4 chips.

### **Data Processing Workflow**
- LISS-4 scenes clipped into **256×256** chips  
- Chips cropped into **64×64** patches  
- Dataset prepared for deep learning segmentation

## **Two-Stage Augmentation Strategy**

### **Stage 1 – Offline Augmentation**
Includes:
- Flips  
- Rotations  
- Elastic transforms  
- Distortions  
- Gaussian blur  

➡️ Expanded dataset to **1,476 samples**

### **Stage 2 – On-the-fly Augmentation**
- Applied via a **stratified generator**  
➡️ Balanced dataset with **1,584 final samples**

Dataset split into **train / validation / test** for robust evaluation.

## 📊 Error Analysis & Validation
Evaluated segmentation performance using:

- Pixel-wise **error maps**  
- Missed-object size categorization:  
  - **Small:** 1–2 px  
  - **Medium:** 3–5 px  
  - **Large:** ≥6 px  
- Vegetation Cover Fraction (VCF) comparison with:
  - **R²**  
  - **RMSE**  
  - **Bias**  

This guided final model selection.

## 🗺️ Wall-to-Wall Mapping
Full-scene prediction workflow:

1. Predictions aligned to original **CRS**  
2. Mosaicked into a **seamless wall-to-wall mask**  
3. Pixel resolution aggregated **5 m → 100 m (~1 ha)**  
4. Final **VCF maps** produced for vegetation monitoring

## 🌱 Impact
This project demonstrates that combining:

- High-resolution reference data  
- Two-stage augmentation  
- MultiResUNet segmentation  

enables **accurate, scalable tree crown mapping**.  
The workflow supports ecological monitoring, land-cover mapping, and natural resource management at regional scales.
