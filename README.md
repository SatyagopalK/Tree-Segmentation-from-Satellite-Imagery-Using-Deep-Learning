# Tree-Segmentation-from-Satellite-Imagery-Using-Deep-Learning
Developed a deep learning pipeline for pixel-level tree crown segmentation using LISS-4 multispectral imagery. Created augmented datasets, trained MultiResUNet with multiple loss functions, performed error analysis, and generated georeferenced wall-to-wall tree crown and VCF maps.
